# Coding assistant architecture 

    think from the first principles what coding assistant needs to be capable of

1. it should be able to read and write to files
2. it should be able to run terminal commands
3. it should be able of file search

    it is possible that the simpler the architecture the better - it will allow for more capable agents to ugrade the workflow significantly without any architecture changes (probably what CC does rn)
